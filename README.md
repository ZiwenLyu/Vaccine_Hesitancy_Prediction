# Final-Project

## Topic of this Project:
Covid 19 Vaccine Hesitancy level Analysis. 

- The purpose of this project is to analyze and predict the level of Vaccine Hesitancy in USA starting from 2020 to present. The datasets which we will be using for statistical calculations and other technology libraries will displays the trends and predict the outcome accordingly. 

- Public mask mandates are correlated with COVID vaccination hesitancy.

- Public mask mandates are correlated with CVAC levels.

- Public mask mandates are correlated with SVI levels.

- SVI levels are correlated with CVAC levels.

- Software & Libraries: Python, PostgreSQL, Flask , Tableau, ML .

## Project Developmental Planning:

- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Python technology with Pandas library will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further Trending analysis will be completed using NumPy.

- **Database Storage**: PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate pgAdmin to display the data.

- **Machine Learning**: ## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is uses a 75-25 split.  Machine learning models used include:
     - Logistic Regression
     - SVM
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Gradient Boosting

- **Dashboard**:  Flask template will be used with a final reporting using an  integrate TABLEAU for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. Finally, it will be hosted on Google Slide.

## Initial Objective:

- Our team members will present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
1. Takes in raw data in from the provisional database
2. Outputs label(s) for input data
3. Mange repositories rendered by  team members 

- Our team members handling Data Management will present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
1. Images of Codes 
2. Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure/schema
3. Provisional draft of machine learning module with code is shown connected to the provisional database
