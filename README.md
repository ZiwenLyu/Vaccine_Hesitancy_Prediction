# Final-Project

The Final Project for GW University's Data Analysis Bootcamp 2021 about Covid 19 Vaccine Hesitancy Analysis using Machine Learning

## Resources to be used:

- Data Source:
https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccines-gov-COVID-19-vaccinating-provider-locatio/5jp2-pgaw
https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Fully-Vaccinated-Adults/jm79-dz78
https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh
https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/U-S-State-and-Territorial-Public-Mask-Mandates-Fro/42jj-z7fa

- Software & Libraries: Python, SQL, Flask , Tableau, ML & Google tools.

## Project Developmental Planning:

- **Data Cleaning and Analysis**: Python technology with Pandas library will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further Trending analysis will be completed using NumPy.

- **Database Storage**: PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate pgAdmin to display the data.

- **Machine Learning**: SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. A prediction analysis will be also done using Neural Network Model. 

- **Dashboard**:  Flask template will be used with a final reporting using an  integrate TABLEAU for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. Finally, it will be hosted on Google Slide.

## Initial Objective:

- Our team members will present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
1. Takes in raw data in from the provisional database
2. Outputs label(s) for input data
3. Mange repositories rendered by  team members 

- Our team members handling Data Management will present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
1. Images of Codes 
2. Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure/schema
3. Provisional draft of machine learning module with code is shown connected to the provisional database
